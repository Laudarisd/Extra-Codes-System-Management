# Answer is 18.944.It seems that point is median when we get shortest distance to travel to point B. 

# I used pythagoras theorem to solve the problem with iteration process becasue the base of the figure is undefined though its total length is 10. 
# I assume that the one part of base is x and another is 10 - x. Although x is constrain,I only used the range of x from 1 to 10.
